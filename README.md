# Home_Sales

In this assignment, I used the knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

Some of the key data metrics questions that were answered:
- What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year?
- What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms?
- What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet?
- What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000?
